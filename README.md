**alefuncs.py** is a collection of functions and classes I have initially wrote during my PhD and Pstdoc and it ended up being my personal collection of useful functions and classes.

Initially written in Python 2.x *(for [PyPy](https://pypy.org/) and [NumPyPy](https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy) compatibility)*, I have decided to modernize it after Python 3.6 was released (I have found the f-strings and the new dict object irresistible). So, consider this module to be **compatible with Python 3.6 and above**.


**alefuncs.py** contains code to deal with a varierty of problems (mostly related to bioinformatics) and a few tools I find pretty awesome (like `print_sbar()`, a light and customizable status bar and `get_size()`, a simple function htat returns the memory size of complex Python objects).
